    "Wastewater from the Distillery is generally well suited for anaerobic treatment due to the abundant presence of organic compounds. MM Enviro has broad experience with a wide spectrum of distillery waste streams, including evaporator condensate, thin stillage (grain, fruit), and raw spent wash/vinasse (sugarcane). Our Anaerobic Digesters ensure the highest removal of organic COD. Generating biogas from effluent streams maximizes energy recovery and reduces fossil fuel consumption. With over 75+ successful references in the Distillery sector, we bring extensive expertise to help the industry generate maximum biogas from effluent streams. High-strength distillery raw spent wash is treated in MM Enviroâ€™s CSTR Digester, whereas evaporator condensate is treated through our advanced CPU process.",
